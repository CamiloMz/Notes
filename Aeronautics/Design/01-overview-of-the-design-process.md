# OVERVIEW OF THE DESIGN PROCESS

Design is an iterative effort. Requirements are set by prior design trade studies. Concepts are developed to meet requirements, Design Analysis frequently points toward new concepts and technologies, which can initiate a whole new design effort.

## PHASES OF AIRCRAFT DESIGN

Aircraft design can be broken into three major phases:

### Conceptual Design

It is in conceptual design that the basic questions of configuration arrangement, size and weight, and performance are answered.

The first question is "can an affordable aircraft be built that meets the requirements?"if not, the customer may wish to relax the requirements.

* Will it work?
* What does it look like?
* What requirements drive the design?
* What trade-offs should be considered?
* what should it weight and cost?

### Preliminary design

Preliminary design can be said to begin when the major changes are over. The configuration arrangement can be expected to remain about as shown on the current drawings, although minor revisions may occur. At some point late in the preliminary design, even minor changes are stopped when a decision is made to freeze the configuration.

in this phase the specialists in areas such as structures, landing gear, and control systems will design and analyze their portion of the aircraft. Testing is initiated in areas such as aerodynamics, propulsion, structures, and stability and control.

Lofting is the mathematical modeling of the outside skin of the aircraft with sufficient accuracy to insure proper fit between its different parts.

the ultimate objective during preliminary design is to ready the company for the detail design state, also called full=scale development. Preliminary design must stablish confidence that the airplane can be built on time an the estimated cost.

* Freeze the configuration.
* Develop lofting.
* Develop test and analytical base.
* Design major items.
* Develop actual cost estimate.

### Detail design

Assuming a favorable decision for entering full-scale development, the detail design phase begins in which the actual pieces to be fabricated are designed.

Another important part is called production design. Specialists determine how the airplane will be fabricated, starting with the smallest and simplest subassemblies and building up to the final assembly process.

During detail design, the testing effort intensifies. Actual structure of the aircraft is fabricated and tested. Control laws for the flight control system are tested on an "iron-bird" simulator, a detailed working model of the actuators and flight control surfaces. 

Detail design ends with the aircraft fabrication.

## AIRCRAFT CONCEPTUAL DESIGN PROCESS

Conceptual design will usually begin with a set of design requirements, which include parameters such as the aircraft range and payload, takeoff and landing distances, and maneuverability and speed requirements.

Before a design can be started, a decision must be made as to what technologies will be incorporated. If it is being designed to be built in the more distant future, the an estimate of the technological state of the art must be made to determine which emerging technologies will be ready to use at that time.

The actual design effort usually begins with conceptual sketch. This is the "back of a napkin" drawing of aerospace legend, and gives a rough indication of what the design may look like. A good conceptual sketch will include the approximate wing and tail geometries, the fuselage shape, and the internal locations of the major components such as the engine, cockpit, payload/passenger compartment, landing gear, and perhaps the fuel tanks.

The conceptual sketch can be used to estimate aerodynamics and weight fractions by comparison to previous designs. These estimates are used to make a first estimate of the required total weight and fuel weight to perform the design mission, by a process called "sizing".

The "first-order"sizing provides the information needed to develop an initial design layout. This is a three-view drawing complete with the more important internal arrangement details, including typically the landing gear, payload or passenger compartment, engines and inlet ducts, fuel tanks, cockpit, major avionics, and any other internal components which are large enough to affect the overall shaping ot the aircraft.

This initial layout is analyzed to determine if really will perform the mission as indicated by the "first-order" sizing. Actual aerodynamics, weights, and installed propulsion characteristics are analyzed and subsequently used to do a detailed sizing calculation. Furthermore, the performance capabilities of the design are calculated and compared to the requirements mentioned above. Optimization techniques are used to find the lightest or lowest-cost aircraft that will both perform the design mission and meet all performance requirements.

The revised drawing, after some number of iterations, is then examined in detail by an ever-expanding group of specialists, each of whom insures that the design meets the requirements of that specialty.

The end product of all this will be an aircraft design that can be confidently passed to the preliminary design phase. While further changes should be expected during preliminary design, major revisions will not occur if the conceptual design effort has been successful.
