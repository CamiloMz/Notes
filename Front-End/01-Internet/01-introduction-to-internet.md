# Internet

## Introduction

#### Network:  A group of computers or other devices which are connected to each other.

At your home you might have a network of computers and devices. Your friend living next door might have a similar network of devices. Their neighbor might have a similar network of devices. All these networks when connected together form the internet.

> The internet is a network of network

The internet was developed in the late 1960s by the United States Department of Defense as a means of creating a decentralized communication network that could withstand a nuclear attack.

## How the internet works:

At a high level, the internet uses a set of standardized protocols to connect devices and computer systems together. These protocols define how information is exchanged between devices and ensure that data is transmitted reliably and securely.

The core of the internet is a global network of interconnected routers, which are responsible for directing traffic between different devices and systems. When you send data over the internet, it is broken up into small packets that are sent from your device to a router. The router examines the packet and forwards it to the next router in the path towards its destination, This process continues until the packet reaches its final destination.

The Internet Protocol (IP) is responsible for routing packets to their correct destination, while the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ensures that packets are transmitted reliably and in the correct order. Other protocols includes:

* The Domain Name System (DNS).
* The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
* The Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS)

A protocol is a set of rules and standards that define how information is exchanged between devices and systems. One of the key benefits of using standardized protocols is that they allow devices and systems form different manufacturers and vendors to communicate with each other seamlessly.

## Understanding IP addresses and Domain Names

An Ip address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network. It is used to route data to the correct destination. IP addresses are typically represented as a series of four numbers separated by periods, such as "192.168.1.1".

Domains Names, on the other hand, are human-readable name used to identify websites and other internet resources. They're typically composed of two or more parts, separated by periods. For example: "google.com". Domain Names are translated into IP addresses using the Domain Name System (DNS). When you enter a domain name into your web browser, your computer sends a DNS query to a DNS server, which returns the corresponding IP address to connect to the website or other resource you've requested.

## HTTP & HTTPS

HTTP is the protocol used to transfer data between a client (such as web browser) and a server (such as a website). When you visit a website, your web browser sens a HTTP request to the server, asking for the webpage or other resource you've request. The server then sends an HTTP response back to the client, containing de requested data.

HTTPS is a more secure version  of HTTP, which encrypts the data being transmitted between the client and the server using SSL/TLS encryption. This provides an additional layer of security, helping to protect sensitive information such as login credentials, payment information, and other personal data.
